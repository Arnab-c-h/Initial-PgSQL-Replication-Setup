# pg_hba.custom.conf for slave
# This file is included by the main pg_hba.conf that was copied from the master.
# For a slave, these rules are typically minimal.
# If this slave is promoted, the main pg_hba.conf (from the master)
# will already contain client access rules like 'host all all 0.0.0.0/0 scram-sha-256'.

# Allow all local connections for administration on the slave itself if needed.
